# Final Project Combining all AI Methods

This was a Pacman AI Capture-The-Flag contest

I Used all previously learned AI Methods, from Q-Learning, MDP, A-Star Search, to smart heuristics. 
The "TEAM" of pacmen work together to overcome the opposing team. The Team coordinates their attacks, 
but quickly switch back to defense if a an attacker is nearby. Check it Out !
